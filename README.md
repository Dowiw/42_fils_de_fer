# 42_fils_de_fer
A computer graphics project for the 42 curriculum. The first of many.

*Fils de fer* is French for "wire-frame models".

It envolves learning how to call functions in the [X11 windowing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) through the [Minilibx API](https://github.com/42paris/minilibx-linux.git) and involves ```-lm``` to calculate pixel coordinates that render 3D points onto the 2D screen pixel by pixel through multiple perspectives and rotation.

**Description:** Given a map with file format .fdf containing altitude values, parse and render these values onto the X11 Window in a way that shows an isometric perspective.

**Extra credit:** Allow rotation, translation (panning), zooming in and out, one different projection, and a bonus of my choice.

## Usage

Tested with:
- GCC 10.5
- C17
- Ubuntu Linux and Windows 11

To compile ```./fdf```:
```sh
make
```
To compile binary with additonal features:
```sh
make bonus
```

To test:
```sh
./fdf maps/ft_maps/42.fdf
```
You may run any file with the .fdf format. These maps should have both equal row and column sizes throughout, and contain altitude values *(optionally: colors for each value delimited by a comma)*. View files inside maps for format.

Technically, .fdf maps are based on the standard [ARC/INFO Grid Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri_grid).

Rendering each pixel with their respective color based on a ratio between the two parent pixels as the line is built.
